# Heart Disease Prediction using Machine Learning

## Project Overview

This repository contains a machine learning project aimed at predicting the likelihood of heart disease in patients based on various health indicators and demographic data. The project utilizes a dataset from multiple hospitals, incorporating anonymized patient information to identify key risk factors for heart disease. By applying data analysis and machine learning techniques, this project highlights my capability to leverage technology in addressing critical health issues.

## Objectives

- **To identify the relationship** between heart disease and various risk factors.
- **To develop a predictive model** that accurately determines the likelihood of heart disease in patients.
- **To utilize data preprocessing,** feature selection, and machine learning techniques to optimize model performance.

## Dataset Description

The dataset includes variables such as age, sex, chest pain type, resting blood pressure, cholesterol levels, fasting blood sugar, resting electrocardiographic results, maximum heart rate achieved, exercise-induced angina, ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest, the slope of the peak exercise ST segment, and the presence of heart disease.

## Tools and Technologies Used

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Machine Learning Techniques:** KNN, Data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, feature selection, model training, and evaluation

## Key Achievements

- **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:** Addressed anomalies and missing values to improve data quality.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Conducted thorough analysis to understand data distributions and relationships between variables.
- **Feature Engineering:** Selected and engineered features to enhance model performance.
- **Model Selection and Tuning:** Applied K-nearest neighbors (KNN) algorithm, optimized model parameters through hyperparameter tuning, and evaluated model performance using cross-validation techniques.

## Understanding the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Technique

The K-nearest neighbors (KNN) algorithm is a straightforward yet powerful machine learning technique used in this project to predict heart disease. Imagine you're at a party and you're trying to figure out if you'll enjoy the music based on the people around you. If most of your closest friends (or "nearest neighbors") are enjoying the music, there's a good chance you will too. KNN works similarly but with data.

Here's how it applies to our heart disease prediction project:

Step 1: We have a dataset of patients where each one is represented by various health indicators (like blood pressure, cholesterol levels, etc.), and we already know who has heart disease and who doesn't.
Step 2: When we get data for a new patient, the KNN algorithm looks at the 'closest' individuals in our dataset. "Closest" here means patients with the most similar health indicators.
Step 3: It then checks what the majority of these closest individuals have in common: do most of them have heart disease or not?
Step 4: Based on this majority vote, the algorithm predicts whether the new patient is likely to have heart disease.
